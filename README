FSchecksum Overview
-------------------

Commands
--------

make: will build FSchechsum without debugging 

make all: same as make

make FSchecksum: same as make

make debug: will build FSchecksum with debugging set
-> there will be extra info printed to the log and STDOUT

make clean: will remove  *.o and executable files from build directory

FSchecksum[_debug] -n NUM FILE: will execute FSchecksum. 
-> NUM and FILE are not optional. 
-> If NUM is not greater than zero or FILE is not a valid file, FSchecksum 
   will exit in with an error. 
-> The NUM argument represents the number of
   worker threads that FSchecksum will create to do the checksumming of 
   files. 
-> The FILE argument should be a valid path to a config file containing 
   files and their expected checksums. 
   - Example config file:

		8c206a1a87599f532ce68675536f0b1546900d7a  test/dat_files/ten_mb.dat
		7d76d48d64d7ac5411d714a4bb83f37e3e5b8df6  test/dat_files/two_mb.dat
		c312da918d0163b8301c70a121b8b0fbd50bc601  test/dat_files/forty_mb.dat

There are test scripts in test/scripts. They must be run from that directory. 
-> run_loop NUM_THREADS NUM_ITERATIONS
   -This script will generate a config file based on files in /usr/bin/ then 
   it will run FSchecksum using this file with NUM_THREADS for NUM_ITERATIONS.
